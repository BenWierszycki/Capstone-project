This repository contains the back-end code for the hourly CRON job that extracts data from Open AQ API and stores it in a PostgreSQL database table.

The Streamlit application uses Open AQ to provide air pollution data for various locations in the UK and around the world. One can view the latest pollution levels, compare with other locations, and visualize pollution trends over different timeframes.
